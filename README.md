### Installation
* I like to use Wamp server, so I suggest installing Wamp server . Once that is installed, execute the following               instructions.

* Run wamp server :exclamation:.

* Make sure you have placed this entire application inside  :open_file_folder: c://wamp/www/my_application.

* Left click on the wamp icon in system tray  It will display list of options Select “start all services”.

* Then open your preffered browser and type localhost in address bar Hit enter :exclamation:  It will show the default page of wamp server.

##

Now include this index.php (my php file name) at the end of the url

Setting Up The Database (.SQL File is present in sql_database_file Folder)
 

* Left click on the wamp icon in system tray and run PHPMyAdmin (Access your database via PHPMyAdmin).

* Go to the Import files tab

* Click Browse, locate the SQL file on your computer (it is present in dbase folder), click Open, and then click Go.
